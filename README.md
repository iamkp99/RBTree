# RBTree
13.3-1 In the RB-INSERT Algorithm, we set the colour of the newly inserted node to red. If we had chosen to set newly inserted node colour to black, then property 4 of a RB tree would not be violated. Why didnâ€™t we choose to set colour of newly inserted node to black? 

13.3-2 Show the red-black trees that result after successively inserting the keys 41,38,31,12,19,8 into an initially empty red-black tree.

13.3-3 Suppose that the black-height of each of the subtrees a,b in Figures 13.5 is k. Label each node in each figure with its black-height to verify that the indicated transformation preserves property 5.
